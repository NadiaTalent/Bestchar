This repository contains sample code to accompany the manuscript:
Character Selection During Interactive Taxonomic Identification: “Best Characters”
by Nadia Talent, Richard B. Dickinson, and Timothy A. Dickinson,
submitted to Biodiversity Informatics (https://journals.ku.edu/index.php/jbi), September 4 2012

The author of the code, Nadia Talent, dedicates the source code to the Public Domain, 
as per http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/.

The sample code is a stand-alone Bestchar program for categorical data; conversions 
of the equivalent numeric-range data are not included, but are discussed in the 
manuscript. It calculates a variety of coefficients for a single character. Two 
versions are given, one in the Python language (http://www.python.org/), and the 
same translated into the R language (http://www.r-project.org/).

The three files are:
* Bestchar.py Python code
* Bestchar.R R code
* charinput.txt an example input file that corresponds to table 5 char 2 in the manuscript.
